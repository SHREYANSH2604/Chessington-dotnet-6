# Chessington

A .NET 6 port of the original [.NET Framework exercise](https://github.com/CorndelWithSoftwire/Chessington).

**Note that Chessington relies on WPF, so will only work on Windows devices.**

## Getting started

- Clone this repo onto your local machine.
- Open the solution in your IDE.

### Running a game

In Rider, just run the Chessington.UI build configuration.

Or from the command line run `dotnet run --project Chessington.UI`

### Running the tests

In Rider you can:

- run tests from the 'Tests' menu. (Tests -> Run all tests from solution).
- run a single test / test suite by clicking the green arrows besides the test method / class.

Or from the command line run `dotnet test`
